# GamingHub Deployment Instructions

This project is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deploying to Netlify with HTTPS

Netlify provides free HTTPS hosting for static sites.

### Steps to deploy:

1. Create a Git repository for this project if you haven't already.

2. Push your project files to the repository.

3. Sign up or log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

4. Click **New site from Git**.

5. Connect your Git repository.

6. For the build settings:
   - Build command: leave empty
   - Publish directory: `.` (root directory)

7. Deploy the site.

Netlify will automatically provide an HTTPS URL for your site.

### Notes:

- The `netlify.toml` file is included in the project root to configure the deployment.

- The redirect rule in `netlify.toml` ensures client-side routing works correctly.

- You can configure custom domains and branch deploys in Netlify dashboard.

## Local Development

You can serve the site locally using any static server, for example:

```bash
npx serve .
```

or

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
